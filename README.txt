==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 79-feature vector with mean and standard deviation of time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': Script used to exctract, clean and manipulate original data.

- 'CodeBook.md': Markdown describing each step as to how we downloaded and cleaned the orginal data including code.

- 'x.csv': Prepared data from 'Training set' and 'Test set' including row and column names.

- 'xSummary.csv': Average of columns in 'x.csv' groped by 'Subject' and 'Activity'.

The following columns are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- Subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- Extracted all columns with 'mean' and 'std' in the column name.
